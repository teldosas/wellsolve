Minimize the Total Pumping Cost from an Aquifer 
to a Water Tank, via a Pipe Network

Supposing that a number of wells pumps water from an infinite 
confined aquifer, transferring the water through pipes to a water tank, 
using this package makes it possible to allocate the pumping flow rates 
so that the overall operational cost is minimized. The user can insert 
the locations of the wells, the pipe network, the aquifer characteristics 
and the water demand and get the allocation of the pumping flow rates, 
the hydraulic drawdowns and the head losses due to pipe frictions.

an Aquifer to a Water Tank, Via a Pipe Network.

## Installation

You can install the released version of wellsolve from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wellsolve")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("teldosas/wellsolve")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r wellsolve, code=xfun::read_utf8('man/examples/example.R')}
```
