Description: Supposing that a number of wells pumps water from an infinite 
    confined aquifer, transferring the water through pipes to a water tank, 
    using this package makes it possible to allocate the pumping flow rates 
    so that the overall operational cost is minimized. The user can insert 
    the locations of the wells, the pipe network, the aquifer characteristics 
    and the water demand and get the allocation of the pumping flow rates, 
    the hydraulic drawdowns and the head losses due to pipe frictions.
